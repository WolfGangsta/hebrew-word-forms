# Biblical Hebrew: Qal Verb Forms

This is an online tool for learning Hebrew verb forms in the Qal perfect and imperfect paradigms, incorporating the vocabulary found in Futato's *Beginning Biblical Hebrew* up to chapter 14 (with the exception of כָּבֵד, since, well, I don't know how to deal with stative verbs yet).

It will cover strong roots, as well as I Guttural, III Alef, I Nun, and III Hey weak roots--that is, what's covered up to chapter 15.

This lesson does *NOT* cover I Yod and I Alef verbs in the imperfect: the vocabulary roots אכל‎, ידע‎, ישׁב, and אמר will only be conjugated in the perfect tense. גאל, I'm not sure what to do with, so right now it is also absent.

This will hopefully count as an Honors Enrichment Contract at Arizona State University by the end of the semester. Enjoy!
