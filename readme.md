# Biblical Hebrew: Qal Verb Forms

This is an online tool for learning Hebrew verb forms in the Qal perfect and imperfect paradigms, incorporating the vocabulary found in Futato's Hebrew textbook up to chapter 14 (with the exception of כבד, since, well, I don't know how to deal with stative verbs yet). It will cover strong roots, as well as I Guttural, III Alef, I Nun, and III Hey weak roots--that is, what's covered up to chapter 15.

This will hopefully count as an Honors Enrichment Contract at Arizona State University by the end of the semester. Enjoy!
